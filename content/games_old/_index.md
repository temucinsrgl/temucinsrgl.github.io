## Introduction
I have developed/prototyped a lot of games and categorized them as [personal](https://piskafir.itch.io/) and [professional](https://selamisafabalik.itch.io/). You can find a list of them after I make clear that;
##### [Personal projects](https://piskafir.itch.io/) are:

- made purely for fun of making it

- not considering the player's experience

- includes extraordinary amount of satire

- AND shouldn't be taken seriously

##### [Professional projects](https://selamisafabalik.itch.io/) are:

- either made for a lecture/company/goverment etc.

- or made as a homework/gamejam project

- (trying to) consider the player's experience

- includes a tiny bit of satire

- AND should be taken seriously (pls)

You can find the professional projects at [selamisafabalik.itch.io](https://selamisafabalik.itch.io) and personal projects at [piskafir.itch.io](https://piskafir.itch.io)
